i want to create a website based on mern stack.
what our work is.
we have a team of lead generation, who have a dialy target for Job fetched and Jobs Applied.
they should e able to view their daily target on thier particular dashboard.
each employe has to fetch and apply on jobs for 1 or more of assigned profiles.(total profiles 4: 1. Raul Rivas, 2. Raul Sanz, 3. Raul Eduardo. 4. Demar Messado.)
they can view their target on website and update what they acheived at the end of the day.

there is an admin portal who can create a user of any kinds.

there is a manager portal who updates the targets and profiles assigned to any person.

the manager should be able to view each employee stats opens his data for the whole month or week or year.

manager should be able to download the .dox report frmat in a specific template which i would provide you later.
